# 💹 Price Prediction Using LSTM
## 📊 Data Collection
Historical price data was collected, focusing on specific time periods to create a comprehensive dataset for training and testing the model.

## 💾 Model Persistence
The trained LSTM model is saved, enabling predictions on new data without needing to retrain the model each time.

## 📊 Prediction and Visualization
- **Excel Output:** Predicted and actual prices are saved in an Excel file for easy comparison.
- **Result Visualization:** Plots are generated to visualize the accuracy of predictions against real prices.

## 📂 Dataset Source
The dataset used for this project was obtained from reliable sources and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning:** Ensured the data was free from anomalies and outliers.
- **Normalization:** Scaled the data to fit within a specific range for optimal model performance.

## 🧑‍💻 Classification Model
The classification model is implemented using Python, leveraging deep learning techniques.

### Key Techniques:
- **Time Series LSTM Classifier:** Utilized for price prediction.
- **Model Persistence:** Saved trained model for future use.
- **Excel Output and Plotting:** Saved predicted prices alongside real prices in an Excel file and generated plots for visualization.
